# Horror Movie Trivia

## To make this game, I did the following:

* I started by creating all the files for the project: index.html, style,css, movietrivia.js, and README.md.

* I pseudocoded what I needed to do to make this code work.

* Then, I did some research and found some good trivia to add.

*  I created the general layout of the html page and added the DOM elements to connect it to the JavaScript.

* Next, I started to add the CSS (the background colors for the answer buttons refused to work like I wanted).

* I then set global variables that I would need for the different aspects of the project: time, score, etc.

* I then got started on the functions, which was the hardest part by far:

    * Start button event
    * Start game (with many if else statements to hide elements on the page)
    * Setting and showing questions
    * Getting the right answers and checking if they were correct
    * Next button event
    * Clearing old answers
    * Countdown timer
    * Scoreboard
